    Completing the Whole Course First and Doing Practical at the End:

Advantages:
Provides a comprehensive understanding of the theoretical aspects before diving into practical applications.
Allows for a structured learning progression where foundational knowledge is built upon.
May be suitable for subjects where theoretical understanding is crucial before attempting practical tasks.
Disadvantages:
Risk of forgetting theoretical concepts if there's a long gap between learning and applying them practically.
Practical applications may seem disconnected from the theoretical concepts if not applied immediately.
Doing Practical Alongside the Course:

Advantages:
Immediate application of theoretical concepts reinforces learning and improves retention.
Helps in understanding the relevance of theoretical concepts in real-world scenarios.
Encourages active engagement and problem-solving skills.
Disadvantages:
May feel overwhelming for some learners, especially if practical tasks are complex and require a strong theoretical foundation.
Requires careful planning to ensure that practical activities align with the course content without overwhelming learners.
