        <p>In October last year, a five-judge Constitution Bench rejected pleas seeking legal recognition for same-sex marriages. Arguing against the petition, Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta had argued that the petitioners seeking legal guarantee for same-sex marriages represent a small section of “urban elite” and do not represent the majority of the Indian population.Disagreeing with this stance, Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud said: “Queer is a natural phenomenon known for ages. Homosexuality or queerness is not an urban concept or restricted to the upper classes of society.” The court though, rejected the pleas, ruling that it is beyond the judiciary’s remit, and such a law has to be framed by Parliament.
